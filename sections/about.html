                Japan has always been on the list. Then one day, it was not just
                on the list anymore. It was happening. This is a personal record
                of everything seen, eaten, and felt during those eight days.
            </p>

            <p>
                I did this trip completely on my own, a true solo adventure from
                January 27 to February 3. Eight days based entirely in Tokyo,
                with a day trip to Echigo Yuzawa and a final stretch in Asakusa
                before flying home from Narita. No grand plan, just the city, my
                Suica card and cash, and a serious willingness to walk until my
                feet gave out.
            </p>
            <p>
                After this experience, I honestly feel like I do not need to try
                other countries. I will always be coming back here. Japan feels
                like a place I will never get tired of.
