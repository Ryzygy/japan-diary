                Landed at Narita, dropped bags, and immediately headed out.
                First stop was Senso-ji, the gates, the whole thing. Then Ginza
                to feel the contrast. Classic first day in Tokyo.

                Spent the day in Shinjuku — the chaos, the crowds, the streets.
                Made a detour to Suga Shrine, famously featured in Your Name.
                Smaller than expected but worth every step.

                Electric Town. Arcades, figures, anime shops, electronics
                everywhere. Could have spent three days here. The kind of place
                that's overwhelming in the best possible way.

                The crossing at rush hour. The scramble is something else when
                you're in the middle of it — hundreds of people crossing from
                every direction at once, somehow without collision.

                More Shibuya in the morning, then up to Ikebukuro in the
                afternoon. Different energy — less tourist, more local. Found
                some good spots tucked away from the main streets.

                Took the Shinkansen out to Echigo Yuzawa — a complete change of
                pace from Tokyo. Snow country, onsen town, and the setting of
                Kawabata's novel. Quiet in a way Tokyo never is.

                Last full day, walked the same streets from day one but noticed
                different things. This was also the day I finally bought my
                pasalubong, taking my time choosing what to bring home. The kind
                of place you could keep returning to and still find something
                new.

                Since checkout was still at 2PM and Tonkatsu Oribe opens at
                11AM, I spent the morning in Akihabara playing arcade games one
                last time. After my final meal at Tonkatsu Oribe, I went back to
                Asakusa, grabbed my luggage, and made my way to Narita. Quiet
                train ride, full heart, already thinking about coming back.
