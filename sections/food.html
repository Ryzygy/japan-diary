                    Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. A
                    premium beef cutlet that you finish cooking on a hot stone
                    grill for your perfect doneness. Simple, interactive, and
                    incredibly satisfying.

                    If you’re a bit far from Ueno, this spot is definitely worth
                    the trip. Their pork cutlet is incredibly juicy and
                    perfectly crispy, literally the kind of flavor that makes
                    you want to come back again and again. After my first bite,
                    I ended up eating here multiple times. It’s that good.

                    Ichiran Super satisfying and definitely worth it for under
                    ¥2,000. The broth is rich, flavorful, and comforting. It is
                    the kind of ramen that makes you realize what authentic
                    ramen is really supposed to taste like. After trying this,
                    you will understand the hype. It is filling, deeply
                    satisfying, and on a completely different level.

                    If you don’t have time, this is the place you’ll naturally
                    end up going to. There are so many meals to choose from, and
                    everything is fresh, not old stock. It is quick, convenient,
                    and surprisingly satisfying. I highly recommend their egg
                    sandwich. It is simple but seriously so good.
